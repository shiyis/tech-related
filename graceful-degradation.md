### The Concept of Graceful Degredation

In this page, I will present everything I have learned about graceful degredation in the most literal and metaphorical sense. Not long ago I came across this idea through cibersecurity and learning about gneeral IT. It's a machine's ability to gracefully handle failures and still be able to manage minimum functionality. This idea of an elegant downfall struck me so very much, not only because metaphorically I have experienced something like this in real life. And this is a momenet of mutual inspiration, so here I will try my best to present everything I have learned, know, and understand about this concept.
